    "overview": "Vitamin B12, specifically in its active form Methylcobalamin, is a dark red crystalline powder that plays a pivotal role in nerve health, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation. It is essential for neurological function and energy metabolism. Methylcobalamin is widely used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products for the treatment and prevention of Vitamin B12 deficiency, and is often preferred for its superior bioavailability over other forms.",
