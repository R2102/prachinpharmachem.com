  "contentHtml": "<p>Croscarmellose Sodium (CCS) is one of those silent, behind-the-scenes ingredients that make tablets actually work the way they should. It’s added in small amounts, yet its impact is enormous. Once a tablet hits moisture, CCS springs into action—swelling rapidly and pushing the tablet apart from within. That quick disintegration helps the drug dissolve faster, which often means more reliable absorption and a better overall therapeutic effect.</p>\n<p>CCS is classified as a super-disintegrant, a term that reflects its efficiency. Ordinary disintegrants help a tablet break down; CCS does it faster, more consistently, and in a wider range of formulations. The material starts with plant-derived cellulose. This natural base is chemically modified and cross-linked to create a structure that behaves like a tiny sponge. Once water touches it, the particles expand dramatically, building internal pressure that fractures the tablet into fine pieces. Smaller fragments dissolve more easily, and that is exactly what pharmaceutical formulators want.</p>\n<p>What makes CCS stand out is that it keeps performing, even at low inclusion levels. Direct compression tablets, wet-granulated blends, chew-ables, coated tablets; CCS adapts to all of them. Its versatility is one of the reasons it has become a standard excipient across the industry.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How Prachin Pharmachem Manufactures CCS</h3>\n<p>Prachin Pharmachem has carved a strong place for itself among CCS manufacturers in India. Their focus is simple but demanding: produce CCS that behaves predictably every time it is used. Achieving this requires tight control at every step.</p>\n<p>Their process starts with purified cellulose. It undergoes carboxymethylation, after which the polymer chains are cross-linked. This cross-linking step is crucial; it defines how aggressively the final product will swell. Prachin Pharmachem fine-tunes conditions such as reaction uniformity, moisture content, particle size distribution, and flow behaviour. Small changes in these parameters can make a big difference in how CCS performs inside a tablet.</p>\n<p>Quality testing is woven into their workflow rather than tacked on at the end. Each batch is checked for swelling index, pH, microbial limits, and loss on drying. Only material that meets strict pharmacopeial requirements moves forward. Their facilities are designed to output CCS with tailored characteristics, an approach that has led them to develop multiple specialized grades for different applications.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Prachin Pharmachem CCS Grades:</h3>\n<h4>1. CCS Grade 711</h4>\n<p>Grade 711 is the workhorse. It suits most standard formulations, offering reliable swelling, smooth flow, and compatibility with both direct compression and wet granulation. If a formulator needs a dependable, all-purpose CCS, this is usually the starting point.</p>\n<h4>2. CCS Grade 711S</h4>\n<p>711S takes the base characteristics of 711 and pushes them further. It flows better. It compresses better. This makes it especially valuable for direct-compression tablets and high-speed manufacturing lines, where uniformity and clean machine behaviour matter.</p>\n<h4>3. CCS Grade G911</h4>\n<p>G911 is designed for speed; extremely fast disintegration. It’s often preferred for ODTs, chew-ables, and formulations where very low CCS levels must still deliver high performance. What sets the G911 manufactured by Prachin Pharmachem apart is its notably high settling volume, exceeding 20, a clear indicator of its strong and immediate swelling capacity.</p>\n<h4>4. CCS Grade R1011</h4>\n<p>R1011 is built for wet granulation. Many disintegrants lose efficiency when exposed to water during processing, but R1011 holds its performance. Tablets that require resilient granules or undergo multi-stage processing respond well to this grade. The grade produced by Prachin Pharmachem is finely controlled at 325 mesh, with more than 90% passing, ensuring excellent uniformity and smooth integration into granulated blends.</p>\n<h4>5. CCS Grade R1111</h4>\n<p>R1111 offers strong swelling power without compromising tablet hardness. It works beautifully in coated tablets, nutraceuticals, and large-dose formulations where structural stability is important but rapid breakdown is still essential. The R1111 manufactured by Prachin Pharmachem meets the latest USP 25 requirements and successfully passes the IR (Infrared) test, confirming its authenticity and compliance.</p>"
